# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  build:
    # Which image should my job run on? 
    # Could also be Windows 2019 (windows-2019) or macOS Monterey 12 (macos-12)

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: This is my build my stage!
